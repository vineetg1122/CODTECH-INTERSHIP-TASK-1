Overview of Home Automation System
Purpose:
A home automation system aims to enhance the convenience, security, and energy efficiency of a home by allowing control of home appliances and systems through a centralized interface, often accessible remotely.

Key Components
Arduino Board:
Acts as the central controller for the system.
Popular models include Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, etc.

Sensors:
Light Sensors: LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to monitor ambient light levels.
Gas Sensors: MQ series to detect harmful gases.
Contact Sensors: Magnetic reed switches for doors and windows.
Actuators:

Relays: 
To control high-voltage appliances like lights, fans, and other devices.
Motors and Servos: For automated window blinds, curtains, or door locks.

Software:
TINKERCAD for simulation 

Lighting Control:

Automatic on/off based on ambient light levels or time schedules.
Remote control via smartphone or web interface.
